# SunRod API

> SunRod is a project based on a global discord-based credits system.
> This can be seen as an economy system, that can be used from one or more discord bots (who obviously ask for access) that can be used to buy premium features of a bot, or used to pay other users for services.
> The special feature of it is that the system will be global and credits will be shared from one bot to one other.
